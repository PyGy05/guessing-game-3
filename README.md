# guessing-game-3

Almost the same as the guessing-game-2 except that the code has changed a bit and python will print the answer in the terminal allowing you to see it.

Clone repo, enter project folder via terminal, run ~ python3 g1.py num1 num2 ~ your michene will then ask you to chose a random number num1 ~ num2. You should see the answer above, so play around with it and have fun!
